# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To identify and fix the biggest UX problems (heuristic violations) in Spotify by comparing it to Apple Music, specifically focusing on how users find and save new music.

## Algorithm:
Select: Choose the 2-3 competing apps and the specific task (user flow) to analyze.

Define Rules: Use Nielsen's 10 Usability Rules (Heuristics) and a simple Severity Scale (0-3) to judge problems.

Inspect (Target App): Go through the task on the main app (e.g., Spotify). Write down every rule violation, its location, and its severity score.

Compare (Competitors): Repeat the inspection for the other apps (e.g., Apple Music) to find their strengths and weaknesses.

Fix: Prioritize the highest-score problems in the main app, and design solutions based on the successful methods used by the competitors.
